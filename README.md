# Steering Committee Restructure

### Request to extend the Steering Committee mandate until 30th October 2026  
### Proposal: Request to approve the new Steering Committee Structure.

## Available Options:
- **Option 0**: No, I don’t want
- **Option 1**: Yes, approve the new Steering Committee Restructure.

## Details

The Steering Committee (SteCo) was first established on September 22, 2023, to formalize Qubic's governance. Initially focused on technology, marketing, partnerships, and community, the SteCo served until March 31, 2024. Over time, new roles such as Ecosystem and Events, Operations & Reporting, and Finance were added to meet the expanding needs of the project.

In April 2024, the SteCo was restructured for a second term, extending until October 10, 2024. This new phase emphasized creating a comprehensive organizational structure beyond just marketing, incorporating tech, governance, finance, and community building.

During its terms, SteCo achieved key milestones, including building core teams in technology, marketing, ops and ecosystem. SteCo also listed Qubic on various exchanges, launched the Qubic website, launched the first mobile wallet, established strong branding, and grew the community significantly across channels. These efforts laid the groundwork for continued growth and set the stage for future developments in 2024 and beyond.

The third term, starting on the 30th of October, focuses on the execution of our strategy to:

1. Develop a vibrant ecosystem for all our stakeholders (tokenholders, miners, partners and institutions) 
2. Advance AI research and core development
3. Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success

## Responsibilities of SteCo

The Steering Committee (SteCo) is a body elected by the “quorum” who are the ones responsible for consensus at Qubic. The SteCo is tasked with the responsibility of contributing to the strategic direction of Qubic, streamlining tactical activities and coordinating day-to-day operations that enhance Qubic's growth and the fulfillment of our visionary goals.

Responsibilities also include:

- Setting the strategic direction and day-to-day operations of Qubic core development and adjacent tech teams such as the front end and integration teams.
- Provide strategic direction and day-to-day operations of marketing growth activities, focused on attracting and retaining new token holders, miners, partners and enterprises to join the Qubic ecosystem.
- Developing and maintaining an operational structure that attracts and develops top talent while keeping Qubic legally safe from scrutiny and regulatory developments.

The SteCo has an obligation to maintain high standards of accountability, ensuring timely execution of tasks, and providing regular technical, marketing, financial, and operational updates to our community to maintain transparency and trust.

The SteCo is tasked to bring new projects onto the Qubic ecosystem but is not responsible for managing individual projects building on Qubic. This ensures that responsibility and accountability are clearly defined and that further decentralization is encouraged.

## Governance

Qubic's governance structure is designed to be transparent, accountable, and flexible. Key principles include:

- **Term SteCo**: Members are chosen for a period of 2 years. Every two years (next one: 30.10.2026), there will be a forced re-election. Existing SteCo members have the opportunity to be re-elected.
- **Removal of SteCo members**: The Quorum and SteCo have the authority to remove workgroup leads at any time through a simple majority vote, ensuring that leadership remains effective and accountable.
- **Compensation for SteCo members**: SteCo members are working full-time dedicated to Qubic and are compensated for their work.
- **Investment in Future Structures**: SteCo continues to invest in research to explore potential opportunities for further decentralization while maximizing opportunity for impact.
- **SteCo Funding**: SteCo will ask for funds from CCF based on a budget process. As SteCo is voted in by the community/quorum/miners, and can also be replaced at any time, the community trusts the abilities of SteCo to deliver.
  
As a recipient of funds from the Computer-Controlled Fund (CCF), a smart contract within Qubic enabling funding for ecosystem projects, the SteCo must maintain high transparency and accountability in all financial matters.

- **Proposal Process**: The SteCo will periodically submit proposals to the CCF for funding, which cover the costs of core development, operations, and marketing activities.
- **Financial Reporting**: A robust financial reporting system will be established, with regular updates provided to the community detailing how funds are being utilized, the progress on funded initiatives, and future financial needs.

## Qubic Legal Entity

By recommendation of our Legal Counsel, we will establish a Swiss association, a legal entity that offers the necessary flexibility for decentralized projects. The incorporation of an association will reduce legal risk for community members including SteCo, founders, and advisors by protecting them through the establishment of a legal wrapper. An association will also allow SteCo to open bank accounts, sign contracts, make payments, sponsor donors, etc.

A description for this entity will follow soon and is not part of this proposal.

## SteCo Team Structure

The SteCo team structure introduces some changes to further professionalize and decentralize the SteCo organization.

- **Alber** will be presented to join SteCo as the Lead Ecosystems and Partnerships.
- **Crypdro** will move to a role within the Ecosystem and Partnerships team where he will manage special projects.
- **JoeTom** moves full-time to Core Technology as he wants to spend more dedicated time on building a product organization within Core Tech. He will continue to be the main contact for all Core Tech at Qubic. JoeTom will continue to support SteCo in the role as an advisor.
- **Zgirt** Zgirt steps up as an interim SteCo member until a CTO for the Lead of the Tech Department is found / hired and approved by Quorum, SteCo and Joetom. Zgirt will help to drive strategy toward computor operators and miners. He will also help the ecosystem team to build out relationships in GCC.
- **Foley** explores the path of hiring a new Marketing Lead with extensive marketing and crypto experience. Until the right person is found, Foley stays as the Marketing Lead and keeps driving it forward.
- **Tom** will stay as the Community Lead and will work closely with the Qubic Community Board (more on that later).
- **Talentnodes** remains in SteCo as the Lead for Strategy, Finance, and Operations.

SteCo will start the search for a Tech Lead and Marketing Lead with great track records in crypto. The open roles will be published on the career page and the community is free to apply. Selected candidates will need to be interviewed and finally presented to Quorum for approval.

With these changes, the SteCo structure will look as follows:

- **Tech Advisory** (led by JoeTom): This group focuses on Qubic’s Core technical development. It oversees the creation, improvement, backlog prioritization, and maintenance of Qubic’s technical infrastructure, ensuring the project remains cutting-edge, functional, and the best infrastructure to build on for developers.
- **interim SteCo Member** (Zgirt) Will provide insides about computors and miners business. Will also help with partnerships and business relations, especially in the GCC region.
- **Marketing** (led by Foley): This group is responsible for increasing the brand awareness and visibility of Qubic. They develop strategies and run day-to-day operations to increase visibility, attract new users, and build a strong brand presence across various paid, earned, and owned channels.
- **Ecosystem & Partnerships** (led by Alber): This group drives crypto partnerships, integration with crypto tools, and exchange listings, crucial for expanding Qubic's reach and making it more accessible.
- **Community** (led by Tom55): This group will manage the Qubic community on Discord and Telegram. It aims to foster a vibrant and engaged community, which is essential for the long-term success of the project. SteCo intends to decentralize the community Discord and Telegram.
- **Strategy, Operations & Finance** (led by Talentnodes): Responsible for SteCo’s operational aspects and strategic projects, including reporting to the community, exploring new organizational structures (e.g., a DAO), legal, and handling talent needs to support Qubic.

## Scope of SteCo

The Steering Committee (SteCo) plays a crucial role in the growth and success of the Qubic project. It serves several vital functions to ensure that Qubic is well-managed and continues to expand and thrive.

### Primary responsibilities of SteCo include:

- **Alignment of Activities**: SteCo is responsible for aligning all activities related to Qubic to ensure they support the project's overall growth. This involves coordinating efforts across various workgroups, ensuring common goals, and maintaining a strategic focus.
- **Public Representation**: SteCo acts as the public face of Qubic, serving as the point of contact for stakeholders, partners, and the broader community. This role is essential for building trust, promoting transparency, and advocating for Qubic's vision and progress to the public.

SteCo has set three major objectives it wants to achieve within the next term:

1. Develop a vibrant ecosystem (token holders, developers, partners, and institutions).
2. Advance AI Research and Core Development.
3. Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success.

In order to achieve these objectives, SteCo developed an external roadmap. We update the community bi-weekly on the progress of the roadmap through SteCo updates on Discord, X, and Telegram.

### Decentralization

The Steering Committee (SteCo) continues to drive decentralization as an important part of its strategy. We’re looking to introduce several initiatives:

- **Increased Focus on Ecosystem Funding**: SteCo will continue to empower the community by creating more opportunities for involvement through ambassador programs, working groups, and more development grants. These initiatives will encourage ecosystem participants to take ownership of various projects and innovations within Qubic.
- **More Transparency and Reporting**: SteCo will start to actively provide monthly financial updates on spending. We will also continue to provide operational and strategic updates through all social channels as before.
- **Decentralized Development**: Where possible we will further decentralize the development of features and applications in the Qubic ecosystem by supporting more community engineering led projects. We encourage open-source contributions through our grants program and for profit contributions through our incubator program. We aim to significantly increase funding for both programs so we can support more decentralization.
- **Decentralized Governance and the Qubic Community Board**: SteCo supports the creation of a Qubic Community Board (QCB), as a last resort for community escalations. SteCo also supports the initiative from the QCB to act as an Advisory Board for the Qubic ecosystem. QCB supports in advising, creating and reviewing guidelines and strategy in alignment with SteCo. SteCo is looking forward to the QCB's proposal and further details. It's also an opportunity to create a wider structure inside SteCo as a joint-effort with the soon to be proposed QCB.
